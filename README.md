# Desktop Organiser

I am sure that your computer's desktop is cluttered with files. It is very difficult to find files from your desktop when you need them urgently. This repository will help your files with respect to date and file-type so that you can spend more time in productive work than in finding files. :)

### Prerequisites

- A computer with python already installed and configured (Python 3.7 recommended).

- Watchdog library for python. 

  ```shell
  pip install watchdog
  ```

### Run

- Copy the folder "UserName" to your Desktop

- Rename the Folder "UserName" to your desired name.

- Replace the destination path in the code to the path of the folder that you copied to the desktop.

- To run the  program execute the python file by: 

  ```shell
  python desktop_organiser.py
  ```
